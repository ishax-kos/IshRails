Rails take a long time to break, but when you break a rail,the adjacent rails become bent rails.
These break much faster.
You can place rails over pits.
You can place redstone dust inside a rail.
or: you can place a drive shaft inside a rail. A motor will cause this to activate connected rails in a straight line.
